# ddcli

## Installing

Assuming you have a working Go environment:

```shell
go get -u github.com/porty/ddcli
```

## Usage

### Exporting all Datadog items

To export all Datadog items to directory `outputdir`:

```shell
ddcli export outputdir
```

# Misc

This is not affiliated with Datadog (the company) in any way.

## TODO

* Maybe something more than just exporting items (restoring?)
